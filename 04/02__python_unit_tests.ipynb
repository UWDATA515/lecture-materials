    "Another principle of testing is to limit what is done in a single test case. Generally, a test case should focus on **one use of one function**. Sometimes, this is a challenge since the function being tested may call other functions that you are testing. This means that bugs in the called functions may cause failures in the tests of the calling functions. Often, you sort this out by knowing the structure of the code and focusing first on failures in lower level tests. In other situations, you may use more advanced techniques called *mocking*. A discussion of mocking is beyond the scope of this lecture.\n",
