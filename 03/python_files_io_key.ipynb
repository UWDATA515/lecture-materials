    "## Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In a Python module, write a function called `read_csv` to read a CSV file (manually - without using pandas or the `csv` module).\n",
    "\n",
    "  The function should take a file name as input and should return a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary containing the `column:value` data for a particular row. You should assume that the file contains a header row with the column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For instance, if the CSV file contains these rows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  id,name,age\n",
    "  1,sarah,30\n",
    "  2,steve,42\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Then the function should return the following list.:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  [\n",
    "      {id: \"1\", name: \"sarah\", age: \"30\"},\n",
    "      {id: \"2\", name: \"steve\", age: \"42'\"}\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the same module, write a function called `write_csv` that takes the same list format from `read_csv`, a list of column names, and a file name, and writes the subset of columns to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For instance, if you call `write_csv(rows, [\"id\", \"age\"], \"output.csv\")` with the list from part 1, then the file `output.csv` should contain the following contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  id,age\n",
    "  1,30\n",
    "  2,42\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  This is a way we might anonymize data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a main function that runs the `read_csv` function on the Pronto CSV file that we download from the City of Seattle at https://data.seattle.gov/api/views/tw7j-dfaw/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD. Then write a new CSV without the personal columns `usertype`, `gender`, and `birthyear`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "* Have the main function take the name of the csv file to read, the name of the csv file to output, and the columns to emit, as user input on the command line.\n",
    "* Make `read_csv` take another argument - a boolean `has_headers` that indicates whether the csv has a header row or not. If `has_headers` is true, the function should behave exactly as it did before. If `has_headers` is false, use numbers for the column names instead, ie `0`, `1`, `2`, etc."
